                <h1><b>Milky Way Galaxy: Our Cosmic Home</b></h1>

                <p>The Milky Way Galaxy is the vast stellar metropolis that serves as our cosmic home, harboring
                    billions of stars, planets, and other celestial objects. Spanning approximately 100,000 light-years
                    in diameter, the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, characterized by its central bulge, spiral
                    arms, and vast halo of stars and dark matter.</p>

                <h2><b>Stellar Population</b></h2>

                <p>The Milky Way is home to an estimated 100 to 400 billion stars, including our own Sun. These stars
                    range from massive, luminous giants to small, dim dwarfs, and are distributed throughout the
                    galaxy's spiral arms, where new stars continue to form from clouds of gas and dust.</p>

                <h2><b>Galactic Structure</b></h2>

                <p>The Milky Way's central bulge contains older stars and dense star clusters, while its spiral arms are
                    regions of active star formation and stellar nurseries. Surrounding the galactic disk is a halo of
                    older stars, globular clusters, and dark matter, extending far beyond the visible boundaries of the
                    galaxy.</p>

                <h2><b>Dark Matter and Halo</b></h2>

                <p>Dark matter, an invisible and mysterious substance, comprises a significant portion of the Milky
                    Way's mass and plays a crucial role in shaping its structure and dynamics. The Milky Way's halo of
                    dark matter extends well beyond its visible disk, influencing the orbits of stars and galaxies
                    within the galactic neighborhood.</p>

                <h2><b>Galactic Center and Black Hole</b></h2>

                <p>At the heart of the Milky Way lies a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*, which has a
                    mass equivalent to millions of suns. Surrounding Sagittarius A* is a complex region of intense star
                    formation, high-energy phenomena, and gravitational interactions, offering insights into the
                    dynamics of galactic nuclei.</p>

                <h2><b>Future Exploration</b></h2>

                <p>Future missions, such as the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft and NASA's James Webb Space
                    Telescope, will continue to study the Milky Way and unravel its mysteries. These observations will
                    provide insights into the galaxy's formation, evolution, and interactions with its cosmic neighbors,
                    advancing our understanding of the universe and our place within it.</p>
