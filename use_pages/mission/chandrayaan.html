                <h1><b>Chandrayaan 2: India's Mission to the Moon</b></h1>

                <p>Chandrayaan 2 is India's second lunar exploration mission, aimed at furthering our understanding of
                    the Moon's surface, composition, and origin. Launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation
                    (ISRO) on July 22, 2019, Chandrayaan 2 represents a significant step forward in India's space
                    exploration efforts and has garnered international acclaim for its scientific objectives and
                    achievements.</p>

                <h2><b>The Mission Objectives</b></h2>

                <p>Chandrayaan 2's primary objective is to explore the lunar surface and study its composition,
                    topography, and mineralogy. The mission aims to enhance our understanding of the Moon's geology,
                    evolution, and potential resources, laying the groundwork for future lunar exploration and human
                    missions to the Moon.</p>

                <h2><b>The Spacecraft</b></h2>

                <p>Chandrayaan 2 consists of an orbiter, a lander named Vikram, and a rover named Pragyan. The orbiter
                    is equipped with scientific instruments to study the Moon from orbit, while the lander and rover
                    were designed to explore the lunar surface up close. The mission also carries payloads from other
                    countries, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

                <h2><b>The Landing Attempt</b></h2>

                <p>On September 7, 2019, Vikram began its descent to the lunar surface, aiming for a landing site near
                    the Moon's south pole. However, during the final stages of descent, communication with the lander
                    was lost, and Vikram's fate remained uncertain. Despite the setback, ISRO's efforts and achievements
                    during the mission were widely praised.</p>

                <h2><b>Scientific Discoveries</b></h2>

                <p>Although the lander's descent did not go as planned, Chandrayaan 2's orbiter continues to study the
                    Moon from orbit, collecting valuable data and images of the lunar surface. The orbiter's
                    high-resolution cameras and scientific instruments have already made significant discoveries,
                    including the detection of water molecules on the lunar surface.</p>

                <h2><b>Future Missions and Collaboration</b></h2>

                <p>Chandrayaan 2 has paved the way for future lunar exploration missions and strengthened India's
                    position as a key player in space exploration. ISRO remains committed to exploring the Moon and
                    expanding our scientific knowledge of the lunar environment. Additionally, Chandrayaan 2 has
                    fostered international collaboration and cooperation in space exploration.</p>
