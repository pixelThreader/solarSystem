                <h1><b>Aditya-L1: India’s Solar Mission Reaches Sun’s Orbit</b></h1>

                <p>India’s solar observation mission, Aditya-L1, has successfully entered the sun’s orbit after a
                    four-month journey, marking another milestone for the country’s space exploration endeavors.
                    Launched in September, the mission carries an array of instruments aimed at measuring and observing
                    the sun’s outermost layers.</p>

                <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has achieved a significant feat by placing Aditya-L1 in
                    orbit around the sun, making it the first such mission by any country in Asia. The orbiter's primary
                    objective is to study the mysteries of the sun-Earth connection, as stated by India’s science and
                    technology minister, Jitendra Singh.</p>

                <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the achievement on social media, emphasizing the dedication of
                    Indian scientists and their contribution to advancing space exploration for the benefit of humanity.
                    Aditya-L1, named after a Hindu sun deity, has traveled approximately 932,000 miles (1.5 million
                    kilometers) from Earth, positioning itself in a stable halo orbit around the sun.</p>

                <p>The mission, reportedly costing $48 million, will focus on studying coronal mass ejections, powerful
                    discharges of plasma and magnetic energy from the sun's atmosphere that can impact Earth's
                    satellites. Additionally, Aditya-L1 aims to investigate various solar phenomena by imaging and
                    measuring particles in the sun’s upper atmosphere.</p>

                <p>India's space program has steadily grown in size and capability over the years, marked by milestones
                    such as orbiting the moon in 2008 and landing an uncrewed craft near the lunar south pole in 2019.
                    With plans for future missions to Mars, the moon, Venus, and crewed missions into Earth’s orbit,
                    India continues to expand its presence in space exploration.</p>
