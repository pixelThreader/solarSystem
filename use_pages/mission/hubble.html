                <h1><b>Hubble Space Telescope: Unveiling the Universe</b></h1>

                <p>The Hubble Space Telescope stands as one of humanity's most transformative scientific instruments,
                    revolutionizing our understanding of the cosmos and revealing the wonders of the universe in
                    unprecedented detail. Launched by NASA on April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope continues to
                    capture breathtaking images and gather groundbreaking data, shaping our knowledge of astronomy and
                    inspiring awe and wonder around the world.</p>

                <h2><b>Unparalleled Vision</b></h2>

                <p>Hubble's advanced optics and location above the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere provide
                    unparalleled clarity and resolution, allowing astronomers to observe distant galaxies, stars, and
                    celestial phenomena with extraordinary precision. Its observations have led to numerous
                    breakthroughs in astrophysics, cosmology, and planetary science, answering long-standing questions
                    and posing new mysteries for scientists to explore.</p>

                <h2><b>Key Discoveries</b></h2>

                <p>Hubble's observations have led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including the precise
                    measurement of the universe's expansion rate, the detection of supermassive black holes at the
                    centers of galaxies, and the identification of exoplanets orbiting other stars. Hubble has also
                    provided unprecedented views of distant galaxies, star clusters, and nebulae, shedding light on the
                    processes that shape the cosmos.</p>

                <h2><b>Repair and Upgrades</b></h2>

                <p>Throughout its three decades of operation, Hubble has undergone several servicing missions to repair
                    and upgrade its instruments, ensuring its continued functionality and scientific productivity. These
                    missions, carried out by space shuttle crews, have extended Hubble's lifespan and enhanced its
                    capabilities, enabling new avenues of research and discovery.</p>

                <h2><b>Public Outreach and Education</b></h2>

                <p>Hubble's captivating images and scientific discoveries have captivated the public's imagination and
                    inspired countless people around the world. Through outreach efforts and educational initiatives,
                    Hubble has helped to engage and educate people of all ages about the wonders of the universe,
                    fostering a deeper appreciation for science and exploration.</p>

                <h2><b>Legacy and Future</b></h2>

                <p>As Hubble continues to explore the cosmos, its legacy as a pioneering scientific instrument and
                    symbol of humanity's quest for knowledge endures. While Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space
                    Telescope, is poised to expand our understanding of the universe even further, Hubble's
                    contributions to astronomy and space exploration will be remembered for generations to come.</p>
