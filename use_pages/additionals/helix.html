                <h1><b>Helix Nebula: Cosmic Eye in the Sky</b></h1>

                <p>The Helix Nebula, also known as NGC 7293, is a planetary nebula located in the constellation of
                    Aquarius. Its distinctive appearance, resembling a giant eye gazing out into space, has earned it
                    the nickname "Eye of God" or "Eye of Sauron." The Helix Nebula is one of the closest and brightest
                    planetary nebulae to Earth, making it a popular target for astronomers and amateur stargazers.</p>

                <h2><b>The Death of a Star</b></h2>

                <p>The Helix Nebula formed from the outer layers of a dying star similar to the Sun, which shed its
                    outer layers as it entered the final stages of its life. The central star, a hot white dwarf,
                    illuminates the surrounding gas and dust with its intense ultraviolet radiation, causing it to
                    fluoresce and emit light across a broad range of wavelengths.</p>

                <h2><b>Structure and Composition</b></h2>

                <p>The Helix Nebula displays a complex structure of gas and dust, with intricate filaments, knots, and
                    bubbles sculpted by the strong stellar winds and radiation from the central star. The nebula's
                    colors are produced by the emission of light from ionized atoms of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and
                    other elements, which glow with characteristic hues when energized by the star's radiation.</p>

                <h2><b>Planetary Nebula Lifecycle</b></h2>

                <p>Planetary nebulae like the Helix Nebula represent the final stages in the evolution of low to
                    intermediate-mass stars. As these stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and begin to shed their outer
                    layers, they create expanding shells of gas and dust that form intricate and colorful structures in
                    space. The central stars eventually cool and fade, leaving behind a white dwarf remnant.</p>

                <h2><b>Observational Studies</b></h2>

                <p>Astronomers study the Helix Nebula using telescopes equipped with specialized filters that isolate
                    the light emitted by ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and other elements. Observations across different
                    wavelengths of light, from ultraviolet to infrared, provide insights into the nebula's physical
                    properties, chemical composition, and the processes driving its evolution.</p>

                <h2><b>Future Exploration</b></h2>

                <p>Future missions, such as the James Webb Space Telescope and next-generation ground-based
                    observatories, will continue to study the Helix Nebula and unravel its mysteries. These observations
                    will provide deeper insights into the processes of stellar evolution, the formation of planetary
                    nebulae, and the fate of stars like our Sun, advancing our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
