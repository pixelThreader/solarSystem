                <h1><b>Neptune: The Blue Giant</b></h1>

                <p>Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is a distant and mysterious world shrouded in
                    blue. With its turbulent atmosphere, dynamic weather patterns, and intriguing moons, Neptune offers
                    a glimpse into the outer reaches of our solar system and the mysteries that lie beyond.</p>

                <h2><b>The Ice Giant</b></h2>

                <p>Neptune, named after the Roman god of the sea, is classified as an ice giant, similar to its sibling
                    Uranus. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane that
                    give it its distinctive blue color. Neptune's frigid temperatures, averaging around -214 degrees
                    Celsius (-353 degrees Fahrenheit), make it one of the coldest planets in the solar system.</p>

                <h2><b>A World of Winds</b></h2>

                <p>Neptune's atmosphere is characterized by powerful winds and turbulent storms, including the famous
                    Great Dark Spot, a massive storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. While the Great Dark
                    Spot has since disappeared, other storms and atmospheric disturbances continue to rage across
                    Neptune's surface, driven by its rapid rotation and internal heat.</p>

                <h2><b>Rings and Moons</b></h2>

                <p>Neptune is surrounded by a system of faint rings and a diverse array of moons. Its rings are composed
                    of dark particles, likely made up of organic materials and icy debris. Neptune has 14 known moons,
                    with the largest and most notable being Triton, a captured Kuiper Belt object with a retrograde
                    orbit and unique geological features.</p>

                <h2><b>The Voyager Encounter</b></h2>

                <p>Neptune was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, providing the first close-up observations
                    of the planet and its moons. Voyager 2 revealed details about Neptune's atmosphere, magnetic field,
                    and ring system, uncovering surprises such as the presence of active geysers on Triton's surface.
                    The Voyager encounter revolutionized our understanding of Neptune and its mysterious realm.</p>

                <h2><b>Unveiling Neptune's Mysteries</b></h2>

                <p>Despite Voyager 2's brief encounter, many questions remain about Neptune and its moons. Future
                    missions, such as NASA's proposed Trident mission, aim to return to Neptune to study its atmosphere,
                    magnetic field, and moons in greater detail. By unraveling the mysteries of Neptune, scientists hope
                    to gain insights into the formation and evolution of ice giants and the outer solar system.</p>
