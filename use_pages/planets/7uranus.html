                <h1><b>Unraveling Uranus: The Sideways Planet</b></h1>

                <p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest in our solar system, is a world of
                    unique features and mysteries. From its peculiar sideways rotation to its icy blue coloration,
                    Uranus presents a tantalizing enigma, beckoning scientists to uncover its secrets and unlock the
                    mysteries of its icy depths.</p>

                <h2><b>The Ice Giant</b></h2>

                <p>Uranus, named after the Greek god of the sky, is classified as an ice giant, comprising mainly
                    hydrogen and helium, with a significant proportion of water, ammonia, and methane ice. Its
                    atmosphere is dominated by hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane giving it its distinctive
                    blue-green hue. Uranus's frigid temperatures, averaging around -224 degrees Celsius (-371 degrees
                    Fahrenheit), make it one of the coldest planets in the solar system.</p>

                <h2><b>A Tilted World</b></h2>

                <p>One of Uranus's most puzzling features is its extreme axial tilt, which causes it to rotate on its
                    side compared to the other planets. This unusual orientation results in bizarre seasonal variations,
                    with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness as
                    Uranus orbits the Sun. The cause of Uranus's tilted axis remains a subject of scientific debate.</p>

                <h2><b>Rings and Moons</b></h2>

                <p>Uranus is surrounded by a system of rings and moons, although they are less prominent and diverse
                    compared to those of Saturn. The planet's rings are composed of dark particles, likely made up of
                    organic materials and icy debris. Uranus has 27 known moons, named after characters from the works
                    of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope, with the largest being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel,
                    and Miranda.</p>

                <h2><b>The Voyager Encounters</b></h2>

                <p>Uranus was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986, providing the first close-up observations
                    of the planet and its moons. Voyager 2 revealed details about Uranus's atmosphere, magnetosphere,
                    and ring system, shedding light on its unique characteristics and geological features. Despite its
                    brief encounter, Voyager 2's flyby sparked renewed interest in Uranus and its mysterious icy realm.
                </p>

                <h2><b>Unveiling Uranus's Secrets</b></h2>

                <p>Despite decades of study, Uranus remains one of the least understood planets in the solar system,
                    with many questions left unanswered. Future missions, such as NASA's proposed Uranus Orbiter and
                    Probe, could provide valuable insights into Uranus's interior structure, atmospheric composition,
                    and moons, helping to unravel the mysteries of this enigmatic ice giant.</p>
