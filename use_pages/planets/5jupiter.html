                <h1><b>Jupiter: King of the Gas Giants</b></h1>

                <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, reigns supreme as the mighty monarch of the gas
                    giants. With its swirling bands of clouds, iconic Great Red Spot, and retinue of moons, Jupiter
                    commands attention and fascination, offering insights into the dynamics of planetary formation and
                    evolution.</p>

                <h2><b>A Giant Among Planets</b></h2>

                <p>Jupiter, named after the king of the Roman gods, is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and
                    helium. It boasts a diameter over 11 times that of Earth and a mass more than 300 times greater,
                    making it the heavyweight champion of the solar system. Jupiter's immense gravitational pull shapes
                    the orbits of nearby asteroids and comets and plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the outer
                    solar system.</p>

                <h2><b>The Great Red Spot and Dynamic Atmosphere</b></h2>

                <p>One of Jupiter's most iconic features is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm system that has raged
                    for centuries in its atmosphere. This swirling vortex, larger than Earth itself, is a testament to
                    Jupiter's turbulent weather patterns and dynamic atmosphere, characterized by bands of clouds,
                    powerful jet streams, and towering thunderstorms.</p>

                <h2><b>A Host of Moons</b></h2>

                <p>Jupiter is orbited by a diverse array of moons, numbering at least 79 known satellites. Among the
                    most notable are the four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and
                    Callisto. These moons exhibit a variety of features, including volcanic activity, icy surfaces, and
                    subsurface oceans, making them intriguing targets for future exploration.</p>

                <h2><b>Gateway to the Outer Solar System</b></h2>

                <p>Jupiter serves as a gateway to the outer solar system, influencing the trajectories of spacecraft on
                    their way to explore distant worlds such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Its powerful gravity
                    assists enable spacecraft to gain speed and change direction, reducing the time and fuel required
                    for interplanetary missions.</p>

                <h2><b>Unraveling Jupiter's Mysteries</b></h2>

                <p>Despite centuries of study, Jupiter continues to surprise and intrigue scientists with its mysteries.
                    From the origins of the Great Red Spot to the composition of its interior, ongoing missions such as
                    NASA's Juno spacecraft are shedding light on Jupiter's secrets, providing valuable insights into the
                    formation and evolution of gas giants both within our solar system and beyond.</p>
